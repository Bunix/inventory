##Usage

Using inventory is exactly like using ordinary Laravel models, and that's because they all extend the Laravel model class.

First you'll have to create a metric that your Inventory is measured by:

    $metric = new Metric;
    
    $metric->name = 'Litres';
    $metric->symbol = 'L';
    $metric->save();
    
Now, create a category to store the inventory record under:

    $category = new Category;
    
    $category->name = 'Drinks';
    $category->save();
    
Then, you'll create an inventory record, and assign the metric and category we just created:
    
    $item = new Inventory;
    
    $item->metric_id = $metric->id;
    $item->category_id = $category->id;
    $item->name = 'Milk';
    $item->description = 'Delicious milk';
    $item->save();
    
Now we have out inventory item created. We'll have to add stock, but to add stock we need to create a Location to bind the stock to:

    $location = new Location;
    
    $location->name = 'Warehouse';
    $location->save();
    
Now we can add stock to our inventory by supplying a number (int or string):

    $item->addStock(500, $location);
